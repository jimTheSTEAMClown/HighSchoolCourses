**Digital Logic Fundamentals - Introduction To Logic & Logic Systems**

This is a set of High School Course Modules for teaching Digital Logic, and Introduction to Chip making and the process to go from Logic, to RTL to GDS-II with the OpenROAD and OpenLANE process.

**Unit Topics, Modules & Lessons**
The following modules will have a set of Lessons.  Each Lesson will have 📰 Lecture Slides, will be acompanied by a 🖼️ Tutorial, 🛠️ LAB Activity, and links to ✨ Resources.  ALso each Lesson, will have 📖 📝 Reading/Writing, 🚀 Quiz, 🔎 Review and ✔️ Mastery Check assignments. The Lecture Slides and Tutorials will be linked to Google slides and docs, where as the assignments (📖 📝 Reading/Writing, 🚀 Quiz, 🔎 Review and ✔️ Mastery Check assignments) will be hosted in a Canvas LMS class Archive.
