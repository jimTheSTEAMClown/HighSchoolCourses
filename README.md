**Digital Logic Fundamentals - Introduction To Logic & Logic Systems**

This is a set of High School Course Modules for teaching Digital Logic, and Introduction to Chip making and the process to go from Logic, to RTL to GDS-II with the OpenROAD and OpenLANE process.

**Unit Topics, Modules & Lessons**
The following modules will have a set of Lessons.  Each Lesson will have 📰 Lecture Slides, will be acompanied by a 🖼️ Tutorial, 🛠️ LAB Activity, and links to ✨ Resources.  ALso each Lesson, will have 📖 📝 Reading/Writing, 🚀 Quiz, 🔎 Review and ✔️ Mastery Check assignments. The Lecture Slides and Tutorials will be linked to Google slides and docs, where as the assignments (📖 📝 Reading/Writing, 🚀 Quiz, 🔎 Review and ✔️ Mastery Check assignments) will be hosted in a Canvas LMS class Archive.

# Note To Future Teacher: #
## How To Use This Beta / Early Access ##
This material is a work in progress. It's also a collaborative effort.  If you want to connect, work on some of these modules, make edits, add your own content, please connect with Ji Burnham (AKA jim The STEAM CLown) at TopClown@STEAMClown.org 

The goal is to have a set of lessons, that scaffold and have students ready to learn about the RTL2GDS chip flow. I'm expecting that many of your students will need to learn about logic gates in general, and probably more about higher level structures/macros like Counters and Shift Registers… All of these lessons still need to be finalized, and this initial goal (Targeting DAC July 2023) is to have the specific OpenROAD Introduction, Tools and Project installed correctly and the ability to run some verification scripts on a Default build of the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) design.  Lastly we have a "Add Your Own Verilog" Design presentation.  Stay tuned for all the follow-on Lessons to do a deeper dive into the Synthesis flow, layout, Timing optimization, etc. Like I said, get involved if you would like to contribute.

**Notes:** This is a comment from @dralabeing that I need to follow up on, where to add some more timing analysis: **Timing analysis is generally done at different stages- first time pre-layout after CTS, post-global-routing, after detailed routing and chip finishing. So this topic can be introduce sooner.**
